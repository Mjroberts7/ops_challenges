# OPS_challenges

### 201 ops challenges 
1. This is the first challenge that was simply creating a variable and outputing it
-[first bash shell file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/helloworld.sh)
2. Created a function that ouptuted the three last instances of login history
-[first function in bash file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/OPs201_function1.sh)
3. Created an array using a function that utilized a for loop to make a folder, add that folder to the array, then make and put a text file within that folder
-[first array in bash file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/arrays_challenge.sh)
4. created a while loop. then grab the ID and kill it for a specified amount of times. 
-[create a loop to get process ID's and kill them](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/loops_week5.sh)
5. This created an empty array and a function that determined what to populate the array with. A while loop with if conditionals determined when and what to do. 
-[write a conditional into a program](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/week6_conditional.sh)
6. Grabbed a hardware component and displayed a fixed amount of information about that component.
-[displaying components from bash](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops7.sh)
7. Description of a batch file that ran a robocopy command. 
-[robocopied batch commands and explained them](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops8_robocopy.md)
8. Powershell Scripts that provided information from the Event Log 
-[individual powershell commands for EventLog tracking](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops9_powershell.ps1)
9. Powershell scripts that displayed processes and start/stops applications.
-[individual powershell commands for GetProcess and applications](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops10_powershell.ps1)
10. Powershell scripts that enabled/disabled firewall settings, Windows features, and registry properties.
-[individual powershell commands for Enable/Disabling features and rules](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops11_endpoints.ps1)

I am learning these skills to strengthen my scripting/coding skills. I am hoping these will come in handy in a career setting in any field. I am learning multiple scripting languages to help with automation/efficiency. Some of these can help when you are tweaking settings in administration or security. These were the first files I created with code fellows.
