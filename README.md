Scripts for multiple use cases using Bash, Powershell, Python, Batch, and NSE

## 201 OP's challenges - 
1. [first bash shell file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/helloworld.sh) - This is the first challenge which was simply creating a variable and outputting it
2. [first function in bash file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/OPs201_function1.sh) - Created a function that outputs the three last instances of login history
3. [first array in bash file](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/arrays_challenge.sh) - Created an array using a function that utilized a for loop to make a folder, add that folder to the array, then make and put a text file within that folder
4. [create a loop to get process IDs and kill them](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/loops_week5.sh) - created a while loop. then grab the ID and kill it for a specified amount of times. 
5. [write a conditional into a program](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/week6_conditional.sh) - This created an empty array and a function that determined what to populate the array with a while loop with if conditionals determined when and what to do. 
6. [displaying components from bash](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops7.sh) - Grabbed a hardware component and displayed a fixed amount of information about that component.
7. [robocopied batch commands and explained them](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops8_robocopy.md) - Description of a batch file that ran a robocopy command. 
8. [individual PowerShell commands for EventLog tracking](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops9_powershell.ps1) - Powershell Scripts that provided information from the Event Log 
9. [individual PowerShell commands for GetProcess and applications](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops10_powershell.ps1) - Powershell scripts that displays processes and start/stops applications.
10. [individual PowerShell commands for Enable/Disabling features and rules](Ops-201-Foundations-of-Computer-Operations/ops11_endpoints.ps1) - Powershell scripts that enabled/disabled firewall settings, Windows features, and registry properties.


I am learning these skills to strengthen my scripting/coding skills. I am hoping these will come in handy in a career setting in any field. I am learning multiple scripting languages to help with automation/efficiency. Some of these can help when you are tweaking settings in administration or security. These were the first files I created with code fellows.

These Are the Scripts I wrote during my time in ops-401 The cybersecurity code fellows bootcamp. They offer a broad range of uses if you want to encrypt, hash, harden, scan, etc... I will continue to develop my skills and add to it. My passion for technology and cybersecurity will only continue to grow as will my arsenal of tools.
